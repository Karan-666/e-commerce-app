# ShoppyGlobe E-commerce Application

## Project Description
This is a modern e-commerce application built from scratch with React. It features a responsive design, a product listing page, a product details page, a shopping cart, and a checkout flow. The application demonstrates a solid understanding of a component-based architecture and advanced state management techniques.

## Features
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive design with a fixed header, modern fonts, and subtle animations.
- **Product Listing:** Fetches and displays products from an external API (`https://dummyjson.com/products`).
- **Dynamic Routing:** Implements client-side routing to navigate between pages without full page reloads.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add, remove, and adjust the quantity of products in the cart, with all logic managed by Redux.
- **Search Functionality:** Filters products in real-time by title and description using Redux state.
- **Performance Optimization:** Utilizes code splitting with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`, as well as native image lazy loading for a faster user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Vite:** For a fast and efficient development environment.
- **React Router DOM:** For handling all application routes.
- **Redux Toolkit:** For centralized and predictable state management.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For fast and flexible styling.
- **react-icons:** For modern, professional-looking icons.
